<h1>Static Routing-Based Enterprise Branch Network with Segmented Department Access</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project was completed as part of my college networking course. It is designed to simulate a branch office setup within a larger corporate infrastructure. The network aims to provide segmented, secure, and scalable connectivity for multiple departments or workgroups.
The implementation of VLANs separates different types of users—such as HR, IT, and Administration—ensuring both optimal performance and enhanced security. The branch office connects to a main headquarters or cloud services through a simulated WAN connection (via Router R4), enabling access to remote resources and internet-based applications. Additionally, internal servers are hosted locally to provide essential services such as file sharing, internal web applications, and authentication.

Routers and switches are configured to support the following:
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Local LAN segmentation
- Connectivity to the upstream internet or corporate backbone
